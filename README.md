<h1>Hey, I'm Tom ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p>I'm a self learning developer from England. I don't know too much when it comes to coding but i do try my best. I like to have fun programming and where I can, I like to pass on what I've learned over my time doing this to others in hopes that more people can get into programming.</p>

<h2>What I'm Working On</h2>

<p>My main goal right now is to get better every day as both a programmer and better my skills. That said, I'm pretty much always tinkering away on some kind of side project.<p>
  
<p>For the last couple of months I've been slowly chiseling away at a small FiveM server using lua and honestly it has been so fun to work on. With that in mind, I hope to be able to start sharing some amazing stuff here (so keep your eyes peeled) ðŸ”¥</p>
